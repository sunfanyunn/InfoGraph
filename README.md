Tested on pytorch 1.6.0 and [pytorch\_geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) 1.6.1

Experiments reported on the paper are conducted in 2019 with `pytorch_geometric==1.3.1`. 
Note that the code regarding of QM9 dataset in pytorch\_geometric has been changed since then. Thus, if you run this codebase with `pytorch_geometric>=1.6.1`, you may obtain results different from those reported on the paper.
